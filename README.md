# evermeet 🔥

A self-hosted platform for organizing and publishing events.

It's an open and libre replacement for centralized platforms like [Luma](https://lu.ma), [Meetup.com](https://meetup.com) or [Devfolio](https://devfolio.co/) and a contemporary alternative to applications like [Pretix](https://pretix.eu/about/en/) or [Pretalx](https://pretalx.com/p/about/).

**The application is now in a state of heavy development and the expected release of the preview version is in June 2024, and the release of the production version (v1.0) in October 2024.**
