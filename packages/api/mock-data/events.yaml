#    ETHBerlin is a hackathon, a cultural festival, an educational event, a platform for hacktivism, and a community initiative to push the decentralized ecosystem forward.
#
#    Loading ETHBERLIN<<04<<<<IDENTITY<<CRISIS<<: May 24-26, 2024, Berlin, Germany.
#
#    The situation is dire. We have been operating in crisis mode for years now. Established systems are failing, new and old imperialist powers are throwing continents into wars of attrition, global supply chains are collapsing, financial markets are tumbling, healthcare systems are falling apart, education is on a consistent downward spiral ‚Äî the list goes on.
#
#    But there is hope: The soils to grow new ideas have never been more nutritious. It has never been more urgent to double down on new revolutionary concepts and ideas. It is high time to change the world.
#
#    For this year's ETHBerlin hackathon, we invite you to join the discourse and hack on anti-identity features instead of identity anti-features that boost the individual's privacy.

      Once a month on the last Tuesday, we bring together contract programmers in Web3. Whether you are a Web2 developer interested to learn more or a senior in the Web3 sphere, our meetup is for you!

      Enjoy a nice cold lager and get ready to blow your mind on what's possible in blockchain.

      Make sure to check out our sponsor, AgorApp!

      **AgorApp provides an interactive coding environment to learn Web3 programming on different chains & protocols. Right now you can take courses & challenges to learn Solidity (Ethereum), Motoko (Internet Computer) Ethereum Swarm & Lisk with more coming! You can check it out at:¬†<https://agorapp.dev/>**

      Last meetup we focused on NEAR smart contract development & how to make on-chain matchmaking for on-chain games.

      Our upcoming meetup will be again hosted at **Decada - a crypto-friendly cafe bar** with an inviting atmosphere and friendly staff. Decada's commitment to innovation makes it the perfect venue for gathering like-minded developers. They are happy to invite us to join them for an evening of fresh perspectives, vibrant discussions, and good company at Decada.

      ## Agenda

      1.  Introduction Radek - 15 minutes
      2.  Remote Talk - Jordan - Building Secure Replicated JavaScript Servers using Azle (Internet Computer)
      3.  Campfire - Radek - Optimism blobbing post-Dencun
      4.  Lightning talks. - 5 minutes each

      Have something to share like a project or protocol in Web3? You get the floor for 5 minutes. Please signup here:¬†<https://app.skiff.com/docs/13f184c2-b297-4c4d-852a-5a0228bf8a64#7a9Wjn7FyRxvZtko3pA0BlMULconqnVMKkMD2PYVSDY=>

      The meetup is focused on contract development. Very tech stuff - down to the byte code. Not frontends and JS Frameworks - there are other meetups for those.

      Example topics will be comparison of proxies, their gas, size, ect. Other talks will be about cross chain / layer calls, blind signing, security, clever hacks, and more. Regarding contracts level - any smart contracts, i.e. not limited to EVM based.

      Have questions or want to share something cool with us? Join our community group on Telegram to get updates or to share knowledge:¬†<https://t.me/+eA4eMYlEo-k2ZGVk>

      We look forward to seeing you all Tuesday, March 26th
